[](TKRoot) is a component to be used as root of (the sub-tree of the app using) the SDK components, and provides the
environment necessary for the SDK components to work: it handles the global state of the SDK ([](TKState)), the TripGo API traffic, and the injection of general and component-specific configs 
to the system.

### Config property

It receives a [config object](TKUIConfig) as property, which allows to specify the *TripGo API key* (required) and 
optionally other general customization options, as *theme*, *i18n resources* (translations of SDK strings), 
*google analytics configs* (including API keys), *geocoding sources*, etc. It also allows to specify component-specific configs 
for any component of the SDK,  which will be applied to the component when rendered anywhere below TKRoot in the tree.

### Global state

The TKRoot component maintains a global state accessible by the SDK components, composed by values and callback 
functions to update them. For instance, the current *routing query* (from + to + time + time preference, 
possibly partially specified), and the corresponding *routing results* 
(computed vÃ­a the TripGo API, if the query is fully specified), are part of the global state.

Some of the SDK components (specially high-level ones) become, by default, **automatically connected to the part** of the 
global state **relevant to the component** when placing it anywhere below TKRoot in the components hierarchy.
This connection happens through the component props: by 
**injecting state values (and update callbacks) as deault values** for some (optional) props that we call 
_connection props_. 

For instance, the query input component ([](TKUIRoutingQueryInput)) has the following optional (connection) props:

```js static
value: RoutingQuery;
onChange: (routingQuery: RoutingQuery) => void;
```

that if not provided when calling the component they default to the query and query update callback of the global 
state.

This feature makes really easy to integrate different SDK components to get the most typical interactions between them.
For instance, the example below integrates [](TKUIRoutingQueryInput) (query input component) and [](TKUIMapView) (map component) 
just by putting them somewhere below [](TKRoot), and so they become automatically connected to the global state.

```jsx
import { TKRoot, TKUIRoutingQueryInput, TKUIRoutingQueryInputHelpers, TKUIMapView, TKUIMapViewHelpers, tKRequestCurrentLocation } from 'tripkit-react';
import { queryMapConfig } from 'doc-helper';
        
const config = {
    apiKey: 'TRIPGO_API_KEY',
    onInitState: state => {
        // Set map viewport to focus user position
        tKRequestCurrentLocation(true, true)
            .then(userPos => state.setViewport({ center: userPos.latLng, zoom: 13 }));

        // Enable directions view flag    
        state.onDirectionsView(true);           
    },
    onUpdateState: (state, prevState) =>
        // Select the first trip by default  
        (!prevState.trips || prevState.trips.length === 0) && state.trips && state.trips.length > 0
            && state.onChange(state.trips[0]),
    ...queryMapConfig
};

<TKRoot config={config}>
    <div style={{height: '500px'}}>
        <div style={{position: 'absolute', zIndex: '1', margin: '10px', width: '300px'}}>
            <TKUIRoutingQueryInputHelpers.TKStateProps>
                {stateProps => <TKUIRoutingQueryInput {...stateProps}/>}
            </TKUIRoutingQueryInputHelpers.TKStateProps>
        </div>
        <TKUIMapViewHelpers.TKStateProps>
            {stateProps => <TKUIMapView {...stateProps}/>}
        </TKUIMapViewHelpers.TKStateProps>        
    </div>
</TKRoot>
```

Then by picking *from* or *to* locations from the query input component it will also be reflected on the map, and conversely, by
dropping a pin on the map it will set the corresponding location as *from* or *to* on the query input.

Also notice that after setting both *from* and *to* locations, computation of routing results via TripGo API is 
automatically triggered, and when the first result arrives we set it as the selected trip (global state value) and so
it becomes displayed on the map. If we also include the [](TKUIRoutingResultsView) component to show the list of all routing 
results, then it will automatically display the trip selection, too (see [TripGo trip planner](https://tripgo.com)).

**Code highlights**
- onInitState and onUpdateState are functions that can be provided through SDK config to do actions on global state 
initialization and update, respectively. Both functions receive the state, which include values and update 
callbacks, allowing to read and write the global state.
- In our example, on state init we calculate the user position and set the map viewport (state value) accordingly, and also
set behaviour mode to 'directions' (further explained [here]()). On state update we detect that routing 
results (for the current query) have arrived, and set the first as the selected one.

**Disconnection from the state**

By explicitly passing a value for a connection property it will avoid that property to connect to the state.
If you want to avoid the connection but don't want to provide any specific value to the property,
then you can explicitly pass _undefined_ as property value.
