You can localize the SDK strings, in english by default, by providing your own replacements strings in the target 
language through the `i18n` property of [SDK config](TKUIConfig).

The SDK does not provide user locale detection, nor string translations for the different languages. 
You need to detect the user locale outside the SDK, and provide through the `i18n` config property the
locale code (like __es__ or __fr__), plus the corresponding mapping of replacement strings in the target language. 
See an example below:

```jsx
import {TKRoot, TKUIRoutingQueryInput, RoutingQuery} from 'tripkit-react';
import { commonConfig } from "doc-helper";
import { useState } from "react";

const config = {
    apiKey: 'TRIPGO_API_KEY',
    i18n: {
        locale: 'it',
        translations: {
            "Start.location": "Da dove parti?",
            "End.location": "Dove vuoi andare?",
            "Transport": "Trasporto"
        }
    },
    ...commonConfig
};

const [query, setQuery] = useState(new RoutingQuery());

<TKRoot config={config}>
    <TKUIRoutingQueryInput value={query} onChange={setQuery} />
</TKRoot>
```

Notice that terms not specified in translations mapping will fallback to english (the default language), as illustrated
by the 'Leave now' untranslated string in the example.

As a reference of all the available keys, so you can provide your own translations, see [here]() the translation mappings 
corresponding to the english (default) language.
