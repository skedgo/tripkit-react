You can localize the SDK strings, in english by default, by providing your own replacements strings in the target 
language through ```i18n``` property of [SDK config](/#/Customization?id=tkuiconfig).

The SDK does not provide user locale detection, nor string translations for the different languages. 
You need to detect the user locale outside the SDK, and provide through ```i18n``` config property the
locale code, plus the corresponding mapping of replacement strings in the target language. See an example below:

```jsx
import {TKRoot, TKUIRoutingQueryInput} from 'tripkit-react';

const config = {
    apiKey: '790892d5eae024712cfd8616496d7317',
    isDarkDefault: false,
    i18n: {
        locale: 'it',
        translations: {
            "Where.are.you.going.from?": "Da dove parti?",
            "Where.do.you.want.to.go?": "Dove vuoi andare?",
            "Transport": "Trasporto"
        }
    }
};

<TKRoot config={config}>
    <TKUIRoutingQueryInput/>
</TKRoot>
```

Notice that terms not specified in translations mapping will fallback to english (the default language), as illustrated
by 'Leave now' untranslated string in the example.

As a reference to see all the available keys and provide your own translations see [here]() the translations mapping 
corresponding to english language (the default).
